                        <p>As the market leader in computer ergonomics, Kinesis has been designing and building premium-grade ergonomic keyboards for more than 25 years. The all-new Advantage 360 features our patented Contoured keyboard design now in a fully split form factor for even more ergonomic adjustability.</p>
                        <p>Separate the two key modules to shoulder-width and rotate them to reduce painful ulnar deviation. And use the integrated tenting mechanism to choose from one of three heights to reduce forearm pronation.</p>
                        <p>The new and improved new SmartSetTM Programming Engine supports on-board programming featuring one-touch macros and remaps. Use the new SmartSet App (Windows & Mac) to customize each 9 Profiles now with 5 programmable layers each.</p>

                            <p>Concave keywells are scooped into a bowl shape to reduce hand and finger extension and relax muscles.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Separating the keywells positions the arms at shoulder-width to keep wrists straight and perpendicular to the home row to reduce abduction and ulnar deviation. <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/solutions/keyboard-risk-factors/#ulnar-deviation" alt="Kinesis Ulnar Deviation">Learn More</a></p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>The keys are arranged in vertical columns (rather than staggered) to better reflect the natural motion of your fingers.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>The two keywells are “tented” to moderately raising the thumb side of the hand. Tenting puts you in a more neutral, “handshake” posture and reduces the stresses caused by forearm pronation. Choose from one of three heights depending on your preferences. <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/solutions/keyboard-risk-factors/#forearm-pronation alt="Keywell information">Learn More</a></p>

                        <div>
                            <p>The integrated palm supports reduce stressful bending of the wrists and provide a convenient place to rest your hands when you are not actively typing. Add the new premium pads for even more support (<a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/ac360pp/" alt="AC360PP">AC360PP</a> Sold Separately). <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/solutions/keyboard-risk-factors/#wrist-extension">Learn More</a></p>

                            <p>The thumb clusters include frequently-used keys such as Enter, Space, Backspace, and Delete to redistribute the workload away from your relatively weaker and overused little fingers to stronger thumbs.</p>
