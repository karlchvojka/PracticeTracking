# Nutrition Label Review 2024-06-25

## Review Purpose

This file is for Reviewing the Nutrition Label Project for FCC.

The finished version will be reviewed.

### Important things to look for

- Code that need to be refactored
- Re-organization that needs work
- CSS that needs to be reorganized.
- The Nutrition Label project result should LOOK THE SAME.

### Todo List

- Global:

- #### HTML Notes

  - Divider doesnt need to be its own element
    - Divider should be a class added to a wrapper div or section or article.
    - Divider should have sub classes (small, medium, large) that can be used as modifiers of the divider class on a wrapper. Not its own thing.

- #### CSS Notes

  - Major sections are seperated by a larger divider
  - minor sections have medium divider

- H1 Heading:

- #### HTML Notes

- H1 is too bold
- bold Class declaration in HTML is not needed. Make this part of the global font h1 styles.

- #### CSS Notes

- header h1 selector isnt needed
  - Refactor header h1 selector to be part of the global font h1 styles as this is the only h1.

- Header:

- #### HTML Notes

  - P tags should be wrapped and styled with selectors based on that. Article?
  - Should the ptags be other elements than ptags?

- #### CSS Notes

- Calories-info:

- #### HTML Notes

- Build a proper layout for this section
  - Left container and a span?
- Should the 230 be a span?

- #### CSS Notes

- Review classes and implementation.

- Daily-value:

- #### HTML Notes

  - Layout for this section needs to be rebuilt
  - Daily value title is fine, and is fine on the right.
  - Initial sections have:
    - title
      - Has label text, measurement amount, and percentage amount
      - Label, and percentage are bold
    - items
      - text is not bold
      - Has label and measurement amount.

- #### CSS Notes

  - Initial Sections:
    - Two columns:
      - Label
      - Daily value

- Vitamins and Minerals:

- #### HTML Notes

- Layout needs to be rebuilt

- #### CSS Notes

- Items are two columns
