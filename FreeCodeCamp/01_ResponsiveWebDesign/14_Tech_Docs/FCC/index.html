        <p>tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.</p>

        <p>As TypeScript and static typing increasingly becomes a best practice in web development, API contracts
          present a major pain point. We need better ways to statically type our API endpoints and share those types
          between our client and server (or server-to-server). We set out to build a simple library for building
          typesafe APIs that leverages the full power of modern TypeScript.</p>

        <h3>An Alternative to traditional REST or GraphQL</h3>

        <p>Currently, GraphQL is the dominant way to implement typesafe APIs in TypeScript (and it's amazing!). Since
          GraphQL is designed as a language-agnostic specification for implementing APIs, it doesn't take full advantage
          of the power of a language like TypeScript.</p>

        <p>If your project is built with full-stack TypeScript, you can share types directly between your client and
          server, without relying on code generation.</p>

        <h3>Use tRPC</h3>
        <p>"Using tRPC" means different things to different people. The goal of this page is to guide you to the right
          resources based on your goals.</p>

        <h4>Becoming productive in an existing tRPC project</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Read the concepts page.</li>
          <li>Become familiar with routers, procedures, context, and middleware.</li>
          <li>If you are using React, read about useQuery, useMutation and useUtils.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Creating a new project</h4>
        <p>Since tRPC can live inside of many different frameworks, you will first need to decide where you want to use
          it.</p>
        <p>On the backend, there are adapters for a range of frameworks as well as vanilla Node.js. On the frontend, you
          can use our React or Next.js integrations, a third-party integration for a variety of other frameworks, or the
          Vanilla Client, which works anywhere JavaScript runs.</p>

        <p>After choosing your stack, you can either scaffold your app using a template, or start from scratch using the
          documentation for your chosen backend and frontend integration.</p>

        <h4>Adding tRPC to an existing project</h4>
        <p>Adding tRPC to an existing project is not significantly different from starting a new project, so the same
          resources apply. The main challenge is that it can feel difficult to know how to integrate tRPC with your
          existing application. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You don't need to port all of your existing backend logic to tRPC. A common migration strategy is to
            initially only use tRPC for new endpoints, and only later migrate existing endpoints to tRPC.</li>
          <li>If you're not sure where to start, check the documentation for your backend adapter and frontend
            implementation, as well as the example apps.</li>
          <li>If you are looking for some inspiration of how tRPC might look as part of a larger codebase, there are
            some examples in Open-source projects using tRPC.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is RPC? What mindset should I adopt?</h3>
        <h4>It's just functions</h4>
        <p>RPC is short for "Remote Procedure Call". It is a way of calling functions on one computer (the server) from
          another computer (the client). With traditional HTTP/REST APIs, you call a URL and get a response. With RPC,
          you call a function and get a response.</p>

        <code>
          // HTTP/REST
          const res = await fetch('/api/users/1');
          const user = await res.json();

          // RPC
          const user = await api.users.getById({ id: 1 });
        </code>
        <p>tRPC (TypeScript Remote Procedure Call) is one implementation of RPC, designed for TypeScript monorepos. It
          has its own flavor, but is RPC at its heart.</p>

        <h4>Don't think about HTTP/REST implementation details</h4>
        <p>If you inspect the network traffic of a tRPC app, you'll see that it's fairly standard HTTP requests and
          responses, but you don't need to think about the implementation details while writing your application code.
          You call functions, and tRPC takes care of everything else. You should ignore details like HTTP Verbs, since
          they carry meaning in REST APIs, but in RPC form part of your function names instead, for instance:
          <code>getUser(id)</code> instead of <code>GET /users/:id</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
        <p>Below are some terms that are used frequently in the tRPC ecosystem. We'll be using these throughout the
          documentation, so it's good to get familiar with them. Most of these concepts also have their own pages in the
          documentation.</p>

        <p>tRPC combines concepts from REST and GraphQL. If you are unfamiliar with either, take a look at the key
          Concepts.</p>
        <h3>Installation</h3>
        <p>tRPC is split between several packages, so you can install only what you need. Make sure to install the
          packages you want in the proper sections of your codebase. For this quickstart guide we'll keep it simple and
          use the vanilla client only. For framework guides, checkout usage with React and usage with Next.js.</p>
        <p>Start off by installing the @trpc/server and @trpc/client packages:</p>

        <code>
          npm install @trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next
        </code>

        <h4>Defining a backend router</h4>

        <p>Let's walk through the steps of building a typesafe API with tRPC. To start, this API will contain three
          endpoints with these TypeScript signatures:</p>

        <code>
          type User = { id: string; name: string; };

          userList: () => User[];
          userById: (id: string) => User;
          userCreate: (data: { name: string }) => User;
        </code>

        <h4>1. Create a router instance</h4>
        <p>First, let's initialize the tRPC backend. It's good convention to do this in a separate file and export
          reusable helper functions instead of the entire tRPC object.</p>

        <div class="code_Container">
          <div class="code_Title">
            <header>server/trpc.ts</header>
          </div>
          <div class="code_Container">
            <code>
              import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';
               
              /**
              * Initialization of tRPC backend
              * Should be done only once per backend!
              */
              const t = initTRPC.create();
               
              /**
              * Export reusable router and procedure helpers
              * that can be used throughout the router
              */
              export const router = t.router;
              export const publicProcedure = t.procedure;
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Next, we'll initialize our main router instance, commonly referred to as <code>appRouter</code>, in which
          we'll later add procedures to. Lastly, we need to export the type of the router which we'll later use on the
          client side.</p>

        <div class="code_Container">
          <div class="code_Title">
            <header>server/index.ts</header>
          </div>
          <div class="code_Container">
            <code>
              import { router } from './trpc';
               
              const appRouter = router({
                // ...
              });
               
              // Export type router type signature,
              // NOT the router itself.
              export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h4>2. Add a query procedure</h4>
        <p>Use <code>publicProcedure.query()</code> to add a query procedure to the router.</p>

        <p>The following creates a query procedure called <code>userList</code> that returns a list of users from our
          database:</p>

        <div class="code_Container">
          <div class="code_Title">
            <header>server/index.ts</header>
          </div>
          <div class="code_Container">
            <code>
              import { db } from './db';
              import { publicProcedure, router } from './trpc';
               
              const appRouter = router({
                userList: publicProcedure
                  .query(async () => {
                    // Retrieve users from a datasource, this is an imaginary database
                    const users = await db.user.findMany();
                    return users;
                  }),
              });
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
